# VR MUSEUM

A virtual tour through a Leonardo da Vinci museum with a virtual guide to explain the paintings.

It was a University group project to evaluate our Virtual Reality knowledge and team collaboration. We had two weeks to prototype the app and draft the documentation and an extra two weeks to develop the app, finish the [documentation](VR_GROUP_ASSIGNMENT_CS203_VR_Museum.pdf) and attach a study case using the app to the report.

## How to use

1. Look at Enter VR Museum for a couple of seconds.
2. To move around you can look at the arrows on the all (what brings you towards them) or you can look at the red rugs for a couple of seconds to be teleported to where it is.
3. Look at a painting to have it's name shown.
4. Look at a painting an touch the screen to have some information about the painting. If you look away, the explanation stops.
5. At the end of the museum you'll see a, elevator door with a button next to it. Look at it for a couple of seconds to be transported to another level.
6. In this new (final) level you can see a sculpture of Leonardo Da Vinci.

## Reflection

- Initially we were going to use Unreal Engine because it was how we learnt to build VR apps. However, it's such a complex game engine that would be overkill to use for such a simple project. So we decided to use Unity and C# (which we already had experience with) and learn how to integrate GoogleVR. 
- It was supposed to be a in-class group project. However, I was raising money to pay my next semester of university, so I got into a medical trial which I had to be locked away for 28 days (the exact same time we had to submit the final version of the project). So, we turned it into an opportunity to develop our team work skills remotely.
- To make sure everything went perfect, we made a development plan, set up our goals and distributed the tasks. To help in that, we used mostly Slack, GitKraken and GitLab to communicate and share the repository with Continuous Integration.
